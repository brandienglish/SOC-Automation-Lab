# SOC-Automation-Lab
Objective
In this SOC automation project, the primary objective is to streamline and enhance the security operations using a range of powerful tools. Kali Linux, running on a Windows host, serves as the foundation for security testing and incident response. The project integrates Shuffle, an automation tool, to orchestrate and automate workflows across various security platforms. VirusTotal is leveraged for malware analysis by submitting suspicious files and URLs to get detailed insights. Security data is collected and analyzed through Kibana, which visualizes logs and metrics from multiple sources, including Wazuh for endpoint monitoring and TheHive for incident management. Cassandra acts as a distributed database for storing vast amounts of log data securely. Automated email notifications are set up to alert security teams of critical findings, such as malware detections, network anomalies, or suspicious activities, allowing for rapid response and mitigation. This setup significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of threat detection, response, and reporting within the SOC

As part of the testing phase, the project was evaluated using Mimikatz, a well-known post-exploitation tool, to simulate attacks and validate the systemâ€™s detection and response capabilities. By running Mimikatz in a controlled environment, the project tested its ability to detect credential dumping activities and other malicious behaviors. The security tools integrated into the automation pipeline, such as Wazuh and TheHive, successfully flagged the malicious activity, generating alerts and triggering email notifications.
